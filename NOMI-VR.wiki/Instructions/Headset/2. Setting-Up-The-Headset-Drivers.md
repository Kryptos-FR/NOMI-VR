#### Installing NOMI VR Headset Driver for SteamVR

The NOMI VR Driver is contained within `NOMI-VR_Headset/Build/nomivr_Driver/nomivr` folder. 

⚠️ You’ll need to set it up by editing the JSON file `NOMI-VR_Headset/Build/nomivr_Driver/nomivr/resources/settings/default.vrsettings`

If you are not using a NOMI VR PCB, you will need to change these:

      "hmdPid" : 9,
      "hmdVid": 4617,
	  
These are the USB HID device's unique Vendor and Product Identifieres (pid/vid)

If you are using and Arduino Due, the correct values will be:

      "hmdPid" : 62,
      "hmdVid" : 9025,
	  
In case you are using a different board, the process to get the right values is as below:

1.	Plug your board in

2.	Select your board in Arduino IDE and click Tools/Get Board info. you will see something like this:

```
	BN: Arduino Due (Native USB Port)
	VID: 2341
	PID: 003e
	SN: HIDHB
```
3.	Make note of the VID and PID numbers. These are hexadecimal values.

	To apply them to the config, they need to be converted to int.
	
	If you are unsure how to do that, there is plenty online converters available.
	
	Such as: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html

4.	Change your hmdPid and hmdVid values to the converted values.

Next, you need to set up the display coordinates and resolution.

At first, you should have the HMD's display set up as a secondary screen extending your desktop,

aligned onto the top right corner of your primary display.


In the config file's "nomivr_extendedDisplay" segment, find and set these:
```
      "windowX" : *whatever your primary screen resolution's width is*,
      "windowY" : 0,
      "windowWidth" : *HMD's native resolution width*,
      "windowHeight" : *HMD's native resolution height*,
      "renderWidth" : *HMD's native resolution width*,
      "renderHeight" : *HMD's native resolution height*,
	  
	  And at the bottom of this segment:
	  
      "IsDisplayRealDisplay" : true,
      "IsDisplayOnDesktop" : true
```  
	  
Make sure not to delete any "," symbols as that will break the config.

Only the last item in the config should not have a "," symbol.


If for whatever reason the above settings do not work out for you try:


Set your HMD display as a mirrored display of your primary display.

Change config as follows:
```
      "windowX" : 0,
      "windowY" : 0,
      "windowWidth" : *HMD's native resolution width*,
      "windowHeight" : *HMD's native resolution height*,
      "renderWidth" : *HMD's native resolution width*,
      "renderHeight" : *HMD's native resolution height*,
	
      "IsDisplayRealDisplay" : false,
      "IsDisplayOnDesktop" : true
	
```	
⚠️ Please note that this may result in keyboard/mouse input not being captured by the VR window, should your game require it, it might become unplayable.

You can also make IPD (Interpupillary Disance) adjustments within the configuration file:

In the "nomivr_hmd" segment find and adjust:

```
      "IPDmeters" : 0.063,
```

You can also change the lens distortion correction by changing these:

```
      "DistortionK1" : 0.4,
      "DistortionK2" : 0.5,
```

You can now install NOMI VR Headset Driver:
- Locate your `vrpathreg.exe` program, usually located at `C:/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/win64/vrpathreg.exe`
- Then open the Windows Command Prompt and run the following commands:
`cd C:/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/win64
vrpathreg.exe`

And then assuming your `NOMI-VR_Headset/Build/nomivr_Driver/nomivr` driver folder is located at:
`C:/code/NOMI-VR/NOMI-VR_Headset/Build/nomivr_Driver/nomivr`
- run `vrpathreg adddriver C:/code/NOMI-VR/NOMI-VR_Headset/Build/nomivr_Driver/nomivr`

Relativty Driver is now installed. You can uninstall it any time by running:  
- `vrpathreg removedriver C:/code/NOMI-VR/NOMI-VR_Headset/Build/nomivr_Driver/nomivr`
